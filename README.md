# Terminal RPG Rewrite
This is the rewrite of a previous project I was working on. I did this because the old project had many, *many* critical flaws in the code. This new version is simpler, more intuitive, and has more dynamic code for future updates. 

# Current State of the Project (04/18)
There is now a very, very buggy and incomplete implementation of some of the logic of the game. [Game.java}(https://github.com/joshuacgunn/RPG-rewrite/blob/main/Core/src/main/java/com/github/joshuacgunn/core/gameplay/Game.java) now exists to test this out. This is still very early, and a lot of things are not implemented. 

# Future Plans
Although I have many things I want to add to the game, it is time consuming to add them. I'm currently a student, and my classes take priority over this project. That being said, I have no plans to drop this project any time soon, and would like to continue working on it until it's at least playable.

# Disclaimer
I'm relatively new to Java, which means my knowledge of how to code certain things is limited. AI has been used in this project to code some things. Most notably the Gson adapters are completely AI generated. I understand how they work, but I do not think I would be able to code them myself.
