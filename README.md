# Dungeoncrawler
This is the rewrite of a previous project I was working on. I did this because the old project had many, *many* critical flaws in the code. This new version is simpler, more intuitive, and has more dynamic code for future updates. 

# Current State of the Project (04/19)
Gamestates are now pretty much fully functional. [Game.java](https://github.com/joshuacgunn/RPG-rewrite/blob/main/Core/src/main/java/com/github/joshuacgunn/core/gameplay/Game.java) has been updated to run the game properly. Shop's do not have any functionality at the moment, but entering/leaving them is possible.

# Future Plans
Although I have many things I want to add to the game, it is time consuming to add them. I'm currently a student, and my classes take priority over this project. That being said, I have no plans to drop this project any time soon, and would like to continue working on it until it's at least playable. Here are some things I'm currently planning on implementing:
- Currency system
- Proper chest rarity generation
- Sidequests
- Bosses
- Unique dungeons
- Unique NPC's
- More enemy variety
- Some ASCII art so the terminal doesn't look so try
- Functional shops (they don't sell anything currently)
- Random events while exploring
- Leveling system
- Proper player class system with different functionalities
- And more to come...

# Disclaimer
I'm relatively new to Java, which means my knowledge of how to code certain things is limited. AI has been used in this project to code some things. Most notably the Gson adapters are completely AI generated. I understand how they work, but I do not think I would be able to code them myself.
